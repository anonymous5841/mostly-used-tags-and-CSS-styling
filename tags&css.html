</head>
<body>

    <style>
        h1 {
            background-color: coral;
        }

    </style>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style,html.css/style.css">

<h1>mostly used tags are span div and section</h1>

<div style="border: 4px solid brown;">div tag is used for moving things together as a block and is a blocked tag
    <section style="border: 2px solid lightslategray;">section tags are child of div tags </section>
    <section style="border: 2px solid lightslategray;">the div tag will move taking everything that is inside it</section>
    <section style="border: 2px solid lightslategray;">like when we replace a whole box of biscuits </section>
    <section style="border: 2px solid lightslategray;">the box is the div tag with biscuits as section tag</section>
    <section style="border: 2px solid lightslategray;">hence as we move the box the biscuits are being move without losing there original place</section>
</div>
    
<span style="border: 2px solid blue ;" >span tag is used in the same way and for the same purpose as div tag.the difference
is its an inline tag </span>

<pre>there are 3 different ways of styling the text in html 
    1) use of TAG ATTRIBUTE method as done above that give border,background e.t.c within the tag.
    2) use of STYLE TAG method as used above with style tag
    3) use of EXTERNAL FILE i.e. of CSS and link it here

</pre>

<pre class="pre1">PREFERENCE:
 TAG ATTRIBUTE is given preferance over the other two 
 STYLE TAG is second preferred
 EXTERNAL FILE is third preferred
 these are the preferrence of this language that if you apply all three on one tag one would appear as an output
 style tag after that and external file as the last one

</pre>

<pre>But the most preferred by website designers is the 3rd one that an external file.
    as it helps you focus on the html written code and you don't end up with a rice bowl with everything mixed up.
    this method done above can confuse a person and will also look bad to look at.
<ul>
<li class="li1"> inorder to link a file of css in html we use link tag and add the name of the folder we have created </li>
<li class="li2">in order to attach a folder firstly we have to creat it and add the tag you are styling </li>
<li class="li3">in the above exapmle i've used h1 tag and add a brown border around it using external file method</li>
<li class="li4">while linking the css file you've made you have to add both folder and file name</li>

</ul>
</pre>

<pre>if you are using more than one same tag like that of pre in the when we have to give color to only 
    pre tag we call that tag by naming it here in html and callig it with a . in css and writting its name 
    like .pre1 in css 
    prefer using auto save option 
    you can check if your auto save is on i.e. when you go online in the search you will se 127.00 or anything like that
